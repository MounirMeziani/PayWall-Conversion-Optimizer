# Placeholder for the GIF File

In a production deployment, the `demo-waterfall.gif` file would be generated by the `scripts/create-gif.js` script. 

This script uses Plotly to render a waterfall chart showing MRR growth and changes, and then generates an animated GIF that cycles through the data to create a visually appealing representation of revenue changes.

To generate this GIF:

1. Run `pnpm install` in the repository root
2. Navigate to the scripts directory: `cd scripts`
3. Run `node create-gif.js`

This will create a GIF file in the `apps/paywall-site/public` directory, which will then be accessible from the dashboard.

The GIF shows:
- Previous MRR: $5,100
- New revenue: +$2,400
- Expansion revenue: +$800
- Churn: -$600
- Contraction: -$400
- Current MRR: $7,300

Resulting in a net MRR growth of $2,200 (+43%).
